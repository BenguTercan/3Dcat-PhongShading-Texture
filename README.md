# 3Dcat-PhongShading-Texture
This is a WebGL application that includes 3D cat model specified with vertices, faces and texture coordinates. Phong polygon rendering is used for lighting. Phong shading is based on interpolation of normal vectors of vertices. Additionally, image of tabby cat is used for texture to cover the model. https://lvgl.io/tools/imageconverter is used to convert the texture image to C code.
